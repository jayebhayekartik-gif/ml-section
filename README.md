## Project Overview
The **Smart Pricing Intelligence Platform** is a machine learning-based system for dynamic pricing of B2B products.  
It uses competitor prices, demand signals, product costs, and other market data to predict optimal prices, helping businesses maximize profitability and remain competitive.

The project is built according to the **Software Requirements Specification (SRS V7.0)**.

## Completed Modules
The following modules have been completed and tested:

- `train.py`: Model training for XGBoost and LightGBM  
- `pipeline.py`: Complete end-to-end ML pipeline integrating data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering scripts in `src/data/` and `src/features/` are ready  
- `requirements.txt` is defined with all dependencies  
- Configurations are stored in `config.yaml`  
- Models can be saved and loaded for predictions  

> **Note:** Hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and dashboard integration are pending as per SRS.
